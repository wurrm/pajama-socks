### This bot wears pajamas.

If SQLite was its cream yellow top and peewee were the little light grey spots,
Python's runtime and dynamic environment would be its slightly-too-short bottoms.
First class and higher order functions would be the fuzzy bunny slippers that keep its feet warm,
and it would have a piping hot mug of freshley brewed websockets with an OOP biscuit before bed.

In a shocking twist however, its pajamas were sown together in around 3 weeks by an underpaid 17 year old who decided to keep the previous set of pajamas in just a single wardrobe, which of course spontaneously combusted.

There is a lot wrong with this program. It's hacky and temperamental, and just kind of almost works most of the time I think.

__However,__ it demonstrates an understanding of and/or has taught me about:
- asynchronicity
- decorators and wrappers
- the runtime in general
- creating APIs
- documentation and its need
- databases
- networking
- optimisation and efficiency in general
- abstract data types
- functional programming
- OOP and factories

Even though there's a lot to improve here (I don't intend to though), I'm fairly proud of it so I thought I'd share my first big project.

Prospective employers, please don't use this as a reference for my current style and knowledge, just as an example of a research experiment.

Please.

I'm begging you.
